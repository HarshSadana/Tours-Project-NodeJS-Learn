What is Express?
1. Express is a minimal node.js framework, a higher level of abstraction.

2. Express contains a very robust set of features: complex routing, easier handling of requests and responses, middleware, server-side rendering etc.

3. Express allows for the rapid development of node.js applications; we don't have to reinvent the wheel.

4. Express makes it easier to organize our application into the MVC architecture.

What is API?
Application Programming Interface (API) is a piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to allow applications to talk to eah other.

The REST Architecture ->

Certain principles must be followed for building the REST APIS.

1. Separate API into logical resources.
All the data that we want to share in the API must be divided into proper resources.
A Resource is the object or representaion of something which has data associated with it. Eg tours, users etc.

2. Expose structured, resource-based URLs
for eg -> https://wwww.natours.com/addNewTour
addNewTour is the endpoint.

3. Use HTTP methods (verbs)
get, post, put(to update the entire), patch (to update the part), delete

4. Send data as JSON(usually)
JSON means combining arrays and objects.
Not only in javascript , used by many languages.
(Refer to the screenshot)

5. Stateless RESTful API: All state is handled on the client. This means that each request must contain  all the information necessary to process a certain request. The server should not have to remember the previous requests.
